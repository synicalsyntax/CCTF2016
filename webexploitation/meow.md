##Solution

We can infer that the flag has something to do with the Scratch project that's not showing up. The most likely explanation for this is because the url link is broken, as the page shows; we can check this by right-clicking and viewing the Page Source.

Next, we analyze the Scratch project link step by step. If you're familiar with Scratch, you'll notice that each project begins with **https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/** followed by a number. In this case, **embed** follows projects to allow the project to be embedded in a webpage, while **?autostart=false** allows the project to be initiated by the user instead of automatically starting.

However, that's not the case with this link. The numbers have been replaced by a string of capitalized letters: **BCGAIDBB**. Perhaps this is why the Scratch project link is broken.

 Though there are many ways this link could be encrypted, a simple first cipher to try is the classic letter-number cipher (A = 1, B = 2, etc.). With this realization, use Inspect Element and change the letters to **23719422**.

 Now, click the green flag to start. Something seems to be appearing under the barrage of rainbow Scratch cats, but how do you actually see it?

 You may stare at the screen for several days to see the flag, or you could go to the Scratch project link directly and click See Inside.

 A sprite inside the project holds the flag.
