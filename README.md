## What is CCTF?

CCTF (CAMS CTF) is an international computer science and cybersecurity competition hosted by CAMSCSC (CAMS Computer Science Club). CCTF debuted globally in spring 2015 and received thousands of participants, and hundreds of teams from countries such as the United States, England, France, Russia, Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, and more, with the aim to inspire students worldwide to pursue their interests in computer science. CCTF encompasses various topics, including, but not limited to cryptography, exploitation, forensics, and programming.

## About CCTF 2016

CCTF 2016 ran from March 20, 2016, to March 27, 2016. 595 teams around the world participated in CCTF 2016. A total of 82 challenges was created for CCTF 2016 in the categories of Cryptography, Web Exploitation, Forensics, Miscellaneous, Programming, and Recon. The first, second, and third place teams were rewarded with prizes of $512, $256, and $128, respectively. Prizes were also awarded to the teams with the best write-ups for the entire competition or the Eden category.

CCTF 2016 was a critical success, and we hope that CCTF 2017 will receive the same crtical success and acclaim as our previous years.
